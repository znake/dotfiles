description
This plugin looks for hex codes of the format #ffffff or #fff and toggles a highlight in that color. It is useful for editing colorschemes, and generally any config file dealing with colors.

Only works with the graphical version of vim.
 
install details
Put hexHighlight.vim into your .vim/plugins directory, or simply :source the file.

The default keymapping to toggle hex code highlighting is <Leader>F2, and the default <Leader> bind is "\", so \F2 should work by default.

The toggle can be called manually by :call HexHighlight()
